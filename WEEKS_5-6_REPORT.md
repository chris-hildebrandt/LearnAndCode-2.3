- **Combined:** 190 minutes vs 215 estimated (-25 min, 12% under)

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### Week 5: AI Tools (Theory/Reflection Week)
**Format:** Reading, experimentation, reflection (NO code changes)
**Status:** ✓ Appropriate for junior developers
**Strength:** Forces critical thinking about AI ethics and responsible use
**Observation:** Different format from previous weeks (no build/test verification)

### Week 6: Git Workflow (Minimal Code)
**Format:** Small documentation changes, Git practice
**Status:** ✓ Excellent - crystal clear instructions
**Strength:** Teaches Git workflow without complexity of large feature
**Time:** Significantly under estimate (efficient)

---

## ISSUES FOUND

### CRITICAL ISSUES: None ✓

### MODERATE ISSUES: None ✓

### MINOR OBSERVATIONS:

1. **Week 5: No Tangible Deliverable Milestone**
   - First week without code/build output
   - Students might question if they did "enough"
   - **Fix:** Add completion checklist in instructions

2. **Week 6: Git Tutorial Scope Ambiguous**
   - learngitbranching.js.org has many levels
   - "Complete the tutorial" unclear - all levels or just basics?
   - **Fix:** Specify minimum levels to complete

3. **Both Weeks: Light on Concrete Work**
   - Week 5: Mostly reading/thinking
   - Week 6: 2 tiny commits
   - Together feel like "break week" after intense Weeks 2-4
   - **Is this intentional?** Good pacing after heavy weeks, or too light?

## CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT

### Week 5: DIFFERENT BUT VALUABLE ✓

**Alignment with Course Goals:**
- Teaches responsible AI use (critical for modern developers)
- Connects to ITT values (customer-centric, collaboration, quality)
- Prepares for AI-assisted development in later weeks

**Why It Works:**
- Theory week after 4 weeks of hands-on coding
- Addresses real concern (AI over-reliance)
- Deep journal questions force critical thinking

**Why It's Different:**
- No code output (first time)
- Heavy reading (most so far)
- Subjective success (no pass/fail build)

### Week 6: PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION ✓

**Alignment with Git Skills:**
- Branching strategy (feature branches)
- Commit hygiene (small, focused commits)
- PR process (review, feedback)

**Why It Works:**
- Uses real codebase (not toy example)
- Small scope (won't break anything)
- Teaches workflow before complex changes

**Smart Sequencing:**
- Git basics now, before Week 7+ when changes get larger
- PR practice before code review becomes critical
- Commit discipline before complex refactorings

---

## DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT

### Week 5: APPROPRIATE (Different Skills) ✓
- **Not technically difficult** (no coding)
- **Intellectually challenging** (ethics, judgment calls)
- **Appropriately timed** (breather after Weeks 2-4)
- **Valuable skills** (AI literacy increasingly important)

### Week 6: EASY (Intentionally) ✓
- **Very simple changes** (1 comment, 1 .http entry)
- **Focus on process** (Git workflow, not code complexity)
- **Perfect for learning Git** (won't get distracted by code problems)
- **Quick win** (builds confidence with version control)

### Combined Assessment: WELL-PACED ✓
- Weeks 2-4: Intense coding (naming, comments, functions)
- Week 5: Mental break (reading/reflection)
- Week 6: Light practice (Git basics)
- **Pattern:** Intensity varies appropriately

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Week 5:

**Add Completion Checklist (2 min):**
```markdown
## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Read AI use policy document
- [ ] Experimented with at least 3 AI tools
- [ ] Documented at least 3 prompt iterations
- [ ] Identified 1 risk per tool
- [ ] Completed all journal questions
- [ ] Ready to discuss in team meeting
```

**Clarify Time Variance (1 min):**
```markdown
Time Estimate: 90-150 minutes
(Varies based on experimentation depth - don't over-invest in perfect prompts)
```

### Week 6:

**Specify Git Tutorial Scope (1 min):**
```markdown
Complete the Git tutorial (https://learngitbranching.js.org/):
Minimum: Introduction Sequence (1-4) + Push & Pull (1-4)
Optional: Complete all levels for deeper understanding
```

**Consider Adding:**
- Optional: "Find and fix a real typo/issue in docs" for extra practice
- This gives faster students something concrete to contribute

## COMPARISON: CODING WEEKS vs PROCESS WEEKS

### Coding Weeks (2-4):
- Concrete deliverables (code changes)
- Clear success (build/test pass)
- Technical skills (naming, functions, HTTP)
- 90-110 minutes each

### Process Weeks (5-6):
- Conceptual deliverables (thinking, workflow)
- Subjective success (quality of reflection)
- Meta skills (AI use, version control)
- 70-120 minutes each

**Both Are Valuable:**
- Coding weeks: Learn what to build
- Process weeks: Learn how to build responsibly

**Together:** Well-rounded developer education

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Are Weeks 5-6 Appropriate for Junior Developers?**

**YES - Different But Important** ✓

**Week 5 Rationale:**
- AI literacy increasingly critical
- Better to teach responsible use than let students figure it out
- Forces thinking about ethics and quality
- Timing: Good mental break after intense coding

**Week 6 Rationale:**
- Git fundamentals required before complex changes
- Small scope = focus on process, not code
- Builds workflow habits early
- Quick win reinforces learning

**Together:**
- Balance technical and professional skills
- Prepare for remaining 17 weeks
- Establish good practices early
- Appropriate difficulty/pacing
