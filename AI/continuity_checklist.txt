# Weekly Module Continuity Checklist

## Purpose
Standard checklist for reviewing weekly module files to ensure consistency, quality, and proper formatting across all weeks.

---

## 1. Agent Meta-Commentary Check

**❌ NEVER INCLUDE:**
- "NEW" tags
- "REVISED" tags
- "UPDATED" tags
- Strikethrough text
- Version commentary ("we've added...", "previously...")
- References to what changed

**✅ CORRECT STYLE:**
- Present tense, authoritative
- Direct instructions
- Clean, as if it's always been this way

**How to Check:**
- Search document for: `NEW`, `REVISED`, `UPDATED`, `~~`
- Look for phrases like "we've changed" or "now includes"

---

## 2. Branch Naming Consistency

**Standard Format:** `week-XX-submission` (where XX is week number)

**Check These Locations:**
- Section 5, Step 1 (first instruction)
- Section 8 (Submission Process)

**Common Errors:**
- `week-XX/<your-name>` (old pattern)
- `week-XX-work` (wrong suffix)
- Inconsistent between Section 5 and Section 8

---

## 3. Section Numbering & Structure

**Standard Structure (11 sections):**
1. Learning Objectives
2. Reading & Resources
3. This Week's Work
4. Files to Modify
5. Step-by-Step Instructions
6. How to Test
7. Success Criteria
8. Submission Process
9. Journal and Discussion Prep
10. Time Estimate
11. Additional Resources

**Exceptions:**
- Week 1: 14 sections (orientation week - acceptable)

**How to Check:**
- Count section headers (`##`)
- Verify numbering is sequential
- Check for missing or extra sections

---

## 4. Time Estimate Accuracy

**Check:**
1. **Inline estimates** in section headers match breakdown
   - Example: "Reading & Resources (45 min)" must appear in Section 10

2. **Math adds up** in Section 10
   - List all time items
   - Calculate total
   - Verify total matches stated total

3. **Consistent naming** of time items
   - Use `–` (en dash) not `-` (hyphen)
   - Format: `XX min – Description.`
   - Total format: `**Total:** ~X hours XX minutes.`

**Example Section 10:**
```markdown
- 45 min – Reading.
- 30 min – Code refactoring.
- 20 min – Journal and discussion prep.
- 15 min – Create PR and merge.

**Total:** ~1 hour 50 minutes.
```

**Math check:** 45 + 30 + 20 + 15 = 110 minutes = 1 hour 50 minutes ✅

---

## 5. Punctuation Consistency

**Rules:**
- ALL bullet points end with periods
- ALL list items use proper punctuation
- Section headers: No periods
- Subsection headers: No periods

**How to Check:**
- Scan all bullet lists in:
  - Learning Objectives
  - This Week's Work
  - Files to Modify
  - Success Criteria
- Verify each ends with period

---

## 6. Journal Question Formatting

**Standard Format:** `*Label: Question text?*`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `*Git Tutorial Reflection: What was the most challenging concept?*`
- ❌ `*Git Tutorial Reflection* What was the most challenging concept?` (missing colon)
- ❌ `Git Tutorial Reflection: What was the most challenging concept?` (missing italics)

**How to Check:**
- All journal questions in Section 9
- Should use consistent italic markdown: `*...*`
- Label followed by colon, then question

---

## 7. Files to Modify Alignment

**Check:**
- Files listed in Section 4 match files mentioned in Section 5 (Step-by-Step)
- No "ghost files" (mentioned but never actually modified)
- No missing files (modified but not listed)

**Example Check:**
- Section 4 lists: `TaskEntity.cs`, `TaskFlowDbContext.cs`
- Section 5 should mention modifying both
- If Section 5 only modifies TaskEntity.cs → Section 4 error

---

## 8. Success Criteria Alignment

**Check:**
- Success criteria (Section 7) match what Step-by-Step (Section 5) actually does
- No criteria for work not assigned
- No missing criteria for assigned work

**Example:**
- Section 5 says "Add Complete() method"
- Section 7 must include "Complete() method implemented"

---

## 9. Step-by-Step Quality

**Requirements:**
- Numbered steps (1, 2, 3...)
- Each step is clear and actionable
- Includes exact git commands where applicable
- Safe for least experienced developers

**Red Flags:**
- Vague instructions ("do the thing")
- Missing git commands
- Assumes knowledge not taught yet
- Overly complex nested steps

---

## 10. Reading Time Estimates

**Check:**
- Inline time estimate in Section 2 header
- Matches time in Section 10 breakdown
- Realistic for actual content

**Video Resources:**
- If videos listed, time should reflect watching them
- Clearly mark videos as optional if not required

**Example:**
```markdown
## 2. Reading & Resources (45 min)

- **Clean Code Chapter 10** (30 min)
- **[Article Title](link)** (15 min)
```

Section 10 must include: `45 min – Reading.`

---

## 11. Additional Resources Organization

**Standard Subsections:**
- Examples (internal course files)
- External Resources (articles, documentation)
- Video Resources (if applicable)
- Deep Dives / Optional (clearly marked)

**How to Check:**
- Section 11 should have clear subsections using `###`
- Internal examples listed first
- External resources grouped logically
- Optional content clearly labeled

---

## 12. Submission Process Standardization

**Section 8 must be identical across all weeks:**

```markdown
> **Reminder:** For your weekly submission, please follow the fork-and-PR workflow outlined in the `SETUP.MD` guide. You will create a Pull Request on your **own fork**, not the main curriculum repository, and then approve and merge it yourself.

1. Create a new branch for your weekly work (e.g., `git checkout -b week-XX-submission`).
2. Commit your changes to this branch (e.g., `git commit -m "feat: Complete Week XX work"`).
3. Push the branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
4. On GitHub, create a Pull Request from your new branch to your `main` branch.
5. Review, approve, and merge your own Pull Request.
```

**Only XX changes** - rest is copy/paste

---

## 13. Assignment-Chapter Alignment

**Critical Check:**
- Reading assignment (Section 2) matches work assignment (Sections 3-5)
- No busywork - every task teaches a principle from the reading
- Assignment is relevant to TaskFlowAPI's actual needs

**Red Flags:**
- Reading about X, assignment does Y (unrelated)
- Assignment feels artificial or forced
- Work doesn't fit naturally into project structure

---
