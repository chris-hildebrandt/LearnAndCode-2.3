# LearnAndCode - TaskFlow API Curriculum

Welcome to Learn & Code, a comprehensive internal course designed to help engineers at In Time Tec develop the necessary skills and knowledge to advance in their careers. This curriculum revolves around Clean Code principles by Bob Martin and incorporates In Time Tec's Quality Manifesto. By the end of this 23-week course, you will have built a production-ready ASP.NET Core REST API while mastering Clean Code principles.

This repository is designed to be forked by each member of the cohort, and contains the structural framework for the TaskFlow API project, as well as weekly assignments and requirements. This course is intended to simulate real-world partner project tasks. When working with our partners, your tasks may be generated by non-technical personnel. You will not always be told how to accomplish the goals of a given task or business objective. It will be up to YOU as the technical specialist to turn the request into a set of practical tasks to accomplish those business objectives. This does not mean you are alone! Every member of this cohort is a part of the same team and you are encouraged to help each other. You also have access to the course leadership, and more experienced devs and mentors outside of the cohort. Reach out if you ever feel overwhelmed or stuck. This is a hands-on job training program; please treat it as you would a real partner project.

## Quick Start

1. Fork this repository.
2. Follow the environment checklist in `Course-Materials/SETUP.md`.
3. Read `Course-Materials/Weekly-Modules/week-01-introduction.md` before touching code.
4. Track completion in `WEEKLY_PROGRESS.md` (100% required each week).

## Course Structure (23 Weeks)

- **Phase 1 · Foundation (Weeks 1-5)** – Quality Manifesto, meaningful names, comments, functions, AI tools & prompt engineering.
- **Phase 2 · Architecture (Weeks 6-10)** – Git workflow, encapsulation, repositories, services, validation & error handling.
- **Phase 3 · SOLID (Weeks 11-15)** – SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP applied to the TaskFlow code you just wrote.
- **Phase 4 · Quality & Patterns (Weeks 16-20)** – File organization, unit testing/TDD, code smells, design patterns, peer review.
- **Phase 5 · Production Ready (Weeks 21-23)** – API design & documentation, performance & caching, final polish + demo.

## What You Will Ship

- `TaskFlowAPI/` – ASP.NET Core Web API with intentional code smells, TODOs, and EF Core SQLite database.
- `TaskFlowAPI.Tests/` – xUnit project with example tests and Week 17 scaffolding.
- `Course-Materials/Weekly-Modules/*.md` – Weekly Journals and Discussion Prep to be filled out in each weeks markdown file.
- `.github/` – PR template and weekly submission issue template to standardise reviews.

By Week 23 you must deliver:
- Clean architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) with SOLID applied.
- TaskFlow database schema + migrations running locally.
- 80%+ unit test coverage on business logic.
- Swagger docs, API versioning, caching, and production-ready README.

## Expectations

- **Job training, not school**: No partial credit. Your code either works or it doesn’t.
- **Time-boxed**: Each assignment is scoped to 1–2 hours. Verify and call out if it takes longer.
- **Get unstuck fast**: Blocked >30 minutes? Ask in team chat, tap the shoulder of the person sitting next to you, or meet with your mentor. DO NOT STAY BLOCKED for more than 30 minutes! No exceptions.
- **Agile discussions**: Our weekly meetings are not lectures, we will have a standup, followed by on-topic discussion followed by a retro. Weekly standup + retro questions are built into every doc. Come prepared.

## Support & Resources

- `Course-Materials/Weekly-Modules/` includes Clean Code chapter summaries, standup prompts, testing instructions, and help paths.
- `TaskFlowAPI.http` contains example requests for Postman or VS Code REST Client.
- `Course-Materials/Readings/Quality Manifesto.pdf` and `Course-Materials/Project-Documentation/TaskFlowAPI_Project_Overview.md` explain the “why” behind every decision.

## Contributing

This repository is production-ready curriculum. You will merge changes only into your own branch/fork of the repo after the weekly review/discussion. Open a PR only when:
- You validated the change with `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`.
- Documentation, TODOs, and time estimates are updated together.
- You followed the PR template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
