# Understanding Auto-Generated Folders

This document explains the purpose of several folders that are automatically generated and managed by the .NET build tools: `Properties`, `bin`, and `obj`. You will not typically need to modify the contents of these folders, and they are usually excluded from source control.

### The `Properties` Folder

This `Properties` folder holds configuration files that affect how the application is built and run.

**`launchSettings.json`**

This is the main file you'll find here. It configures how the project is launched when you press the "Run" button in your IDE (like Visual Studio or VS Code).

**Key Settings It Controls:**

- **Launch Profiles:** It defines different profiles for running the app, such as:
  - `http` / `https`: Configures the application to run as a web server with specific URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
  - `IIS Express`: Configures the app to run using the IIS Express web server on Windows.
- **Environment Variables:** It allows you to set environment variables for different profiles. A common one is `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`, which is often set to `"Development"` for local debugging. This allows the app to behave differently in development (e.g., showing detailed error pages) versus in production.

**Can you ignore this folder?**

Mostly, yes. You typically don't need to edit `launchSettings.json` unless you want to change the port number your application runs on or modify other startup behaviors. It's safe to leave it as is.

### The `bin` Folder (Binaries)

The `bin` folder contains the **final compiled output** of the TaskFlowAPI project. When you build or run the application, the resulting `.dll` (Dynamic Link Library) and `.exe` (Executable) files are placed here, along with all their dependencies.

**Key Points:**

- **You can safely ignore this folder.** The files here are the result of the build process, not the source code itself.
- You should not directly modify any files in this directory.
- This folder is almost always excluded from version control in `.gitignore`.

In short, this is where the "finished product" of your code resides after compilation, ready to be run by the .NET runtime.

### The `obj` Folder (Objects)

The `obj` folder is also automatically generated by the .NET build process. It contains **intermediate object files** and other temporary data needed to compile the project.

**Key Points:**

- **You can safely ignore this folder.** There is no need to read, modify, or commit any files within this directory.
- It is automatically managed by the build tools.
- It is typically excluded from version control (e.g., via `.gitignore`).

Think of this as a temporary workspace for the compiler. It's essential for the build process but not part of the human-readable source code.
