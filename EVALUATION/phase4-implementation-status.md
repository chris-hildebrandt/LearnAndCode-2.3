## Critical Findings

### Must-Fix Issues

1. **Week 11: SRP Smell Detector Detail Missing**
   - **Issue:** Framework mentioned in instructions but not detailed in Section 11
   - **Impact:** Students may not have clear decision criteria for extraction
   - **Fix:** Add detailed SRP Smell Detector framework to Section 11 (model after Week 2's Name Analysis Worksheet)

2. **Week 12, 17, 23: Section Numbering Conflicts**
   - **Issue:** Section 11 appears twice in these files (Additional Resources and new content)
   - **Impact:** Confusing navigation, inconsistent structure
   - **Fix:** Renumber sections so Additional Resources is always last

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Week 3: Comment Analysis Worksheet**
   - **Current:** Good examples provided
   - **Enhancement:** Add structured worksheet similar to Week 2 (categorize each comment: delete, keep, rewrite)
   - **Benefit:** Forces deeper thinking about comment necessity

2. **Week 10: Error Handling Decision Framework**
   - **Current:** Good examples and patterns
   - **Enhancement:** Add decision matrix for "when to throw vs. return null"
   - **Benefit:** Guides exception design decisions

3. **Week 14: ISP Violation Detection Guide**
   - **Current:** Good templates and examples
   - **Enhancement:** Add decision framework for identifying fat interfaces
   - **Benefit:** Helps students recognize when to split interfaces
