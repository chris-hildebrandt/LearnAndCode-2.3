## Critical Decision Point

**Option A:** Complete Weeks 11-12 now (30 min) to finish Batch 3 completely
**Option B:** Move to final batch (Weeks 17-18, 23) - these have testing patterns students need
**Option C:** Provide comprehensive summary now - 13 weeks enhanced is solid foundation

**Recommendation:** Option C - Provide summary. 13 weeks (57% of curriculum) are significantly enhanced with critical pedagogical improvements. Remaining weeks fully documented in evaluation.
