### Learning Philosophy

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Type every line of code manually** - No copy/paste from AI
2. **Read error messages completely** - Debug before asking AI
3. **Understand before moving on** - No "magic code" figure out WHY it worked
4. **Pair program frequently** - Learn from each other
5. **Document as you learn** - Write your own notes

**When to Use AI:**
- Explaining concepts after you've tried to understand
- Code reviews (not code generation)
- Architecture discussions
- Debugging after 30+ minutes stuck
- Generating boilerplate code (e.g., constructors, getters, setters).
- Writing unit tests for existing code.
- Translating code from one language to another.

**When NOT to Use AI:**
- Writing your first implementation
- "Just make it work" requests
- Skipping fundamentals
- Avoiding reading documentation

## AI as a Junior Developer

Treat the AI as a junior pair programmer. Your role is to be the senior developer, responsible for reviewing, critiquing, and improving the AI's output. This promotes code review skills and a deeper understanding of the code. You cannot effectively lead a junior in development of a project you do not understand.

## When You're Stuck

**30-Minute Rule:**
1. Read error message completely
2. Search error in documentation
3. Check Stack Overflow
4. Try different approach
5. After 30 mins if you are still blocked: Ask for help! 
    - Ask another team member
    - post your question in team chat
    - tap the shoulder of someone sitting near you.
    - reach out to a mentor or senior dev
    - research online or though AI cautiously.

**Learn from Being Stuck:**
- Document the problem
- Document the solution
- Share with team
- Add to your learning journal

## Final Advice

This can be hard. You may become frustrated. That's normal and means you're learning.
AI is a necessary tool in the software development environment today, but it will hinder rather than help if it is used blindly or without understanding the code you are working with and the bigger picture that the LLM context cannot contain. Develop your own understanding first, and your ability to use your tools second.

The goal is to:
1. Understand the fundamentals deeply
2. Build real things you can explain
3. Develop problem-solving skills
4. Learn to learn new technologies

Our partners want people who can figure things out, not people who memorized tutorials.

Good luck.
