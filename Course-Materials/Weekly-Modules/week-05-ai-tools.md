# Week 5: AI Tools & Prompt Engineering

This week, we are focusing on how developers can leverage AI tools and prompt engineering techniques to enhance their research and development processes. We will explore core concepts, best practices, and practical applications of AI in software development.

## 1. Learning Objectives

- Understand the strengths and limitations of Large Language Models in day-to-day engineering.
- Craft effective prompts that accelerate work.
- Understand the ethical and legal problems associated with AI use in the professional setting, and how these relate to the Quality Manifesto and ITT values.

## 2. Reading & Resources (60-120 min)

- **`learn-and-code-ai-use-rules.md`** - Our AI use policy for this course.

### AI Safety and Ethics:
- **[AI Safety Considerations](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HdWKEWfifaEcXAj4j/ai-safety-fundamentals-curriculum)**

### Understanding LLMs:
(read at least one of the following:)
- **[What are Large Language Models? | A Comprehensive LLMs Guide](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/large-language-models)**
- **[How do large language models work?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/)**

### Prompt Engineering:
(read at least one of the following:)
- **[Prompt Engineering Techniques](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)**
- **[Google AI: Prompt Design Best Practices](https://ai.google/static/documents/prompt-design-best-practices.pdf)**
- **[Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Tutorial](https://www.anthropic.com/index/a-guide-to-writing-prompts-for-text-generation-ai)**

## 3. This Week’s Work

- Experiment with an AI-powered tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Perplexity, Claude/GPT playground).

## 4. Files to Modify

- This file (`Course-Materials/Weekly-Modules/week-05-ai-tools.md`) – append your journal and discussion prompt responses.
- `WEEKLY_PROGRESS.md`

## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Branch `week-05/<your-name>`.
2. Review `llm.txt` so you operate within policy.
3. Select three AI tools and define the `TaskFlow` scenario you will target.
4. Iterate on prompts; capture best version + produced insights (screenshots or text in journal).
5. Identify one risk per tool (hallucination, stale context, over-reliance) and mitigation.
6. Summarise outcomes in the Journal section of this doc (add a new bullet list under “Learner Notes”).
7. If you modified code/config while experimenting, run build/tests.

## 6. How to Test

No testing this week.

## 7. Success Criteria

- Journal and Discussion prep completed and you are ready to participate in this week's discussion.

## 8. Submission Process

1. Commit `Week 05 – AI prompt engineering`.
2. PR summary links to journal bullets and attaches screenshots/logs as needed.
3. Weekly issue includes a brief description of the AI tool(s) evaluated.

## 9. Journal and Discussion Prep

(Use this section as a journal of your learning. Answer the questions below after completing the reading and assignment. ALSO record any questions or comments you would like to bring up during this week's discussion.)

### Journal:
(add responses under **Learner Notes** at the end of this file):
- *Prompt Evolution: Which prompt iteration delivered the best balance of accuracy and brevity?*
- *Human Oversight: Describe a time AI output was misleading. How did you detect and correct it?*
- *Core values: How do you believe ITT values and the Quality Manifesto should reflect in our use of AI tools with partner code?*

### Discussion Prep:
- *Share examples of how AI tools enhanced your development process and any unexpected challenges you faced.*
- *Discuss the most effective prompts you created for development tasks and explain your reasoning.*
- *Compare the performance and usefulness of different AI-powered developer tools you experimented with.*
- *Explore the ethical considerations and potential biases in AI-assisted development.*
- *Brainstorm innovative ways to integrate AI tools into your team's development workflow.*
- *What signals tell you to stop iterating with AI and switch to manual investigation?*
- *How will you use AI responsibly in today's highly demanding work environment?*

## 10. Time Estimate

- 60 min – Reading + tool setup.
- 45 min – Prompt experimentation + documentation.
- 15 min – PR/issue + sharing artefacts.
**Total:** ~120 minutes.
